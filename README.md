# Shopify Birthday Suit

Shopify Birthday Suit is an exceedingly bare bones [Shopify](http://shopify.com/) theme intended for use by theme developers as a basis for their own theme development. It is not intended to be used "as is", rather as a building block. Feel free to modify and use for your own means.

## Install

To install the theme download the ZIP file and upload the same ZIP file to your Shopify store. Full details on uploading a theme can be found in the official [Shopify docs](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/the-basics/build-your-theme/upload-theme).

## What's included?

### Assets Folder

The theme layout file references a <code>shop.js</code> and <code>style.css</code> file. Both of these are empty - intentionally. Consequently the theme is rendered with default browser styling and zero JS interactions.

### Config Folder

An empty <code>settings_schema.json</code> file is included. Build on this and add in your own settings. Full info on theme settings can be found in the [Shopify Docs](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/theme-development/storefront-editor/settings-schema).

### Layout Folder

The default layout file <code>theme.layout</code> is included. It includes a reference to the latest release of jQuery and adds some useful classes based on page titles and templates to the body element.

A basic header element is included that includes Liquid code to output the current cart item count along with a link to the checkout.

Finally I have included code to output a simple navigation list using the default link-list titled <code>main-menu</code>.

### Templates

The following are included with a reference to a "main" section each, following the Dawn example. For example <code>product.json</code> contains a reference to <code>main-product.liquid</code> section. Each main section contains just some very basic boilerplate code for you to start developing from.

All of the following templates are intentionally very basic and designed as starting points:

-   <code>404.json</code>
-   <code>article.json</code>
-   <code>blog.json</code>
-   <code>cart.json</code>
-   <code>collection.json</code>
-   <code>index.json</code>
-   <code>list-collections.json</code>
-   <code>page.json</code>
-   <code>password.json</code>
-   <code>product.json</code>
-   <code>search.json</code>

### Locales

There is a basic default English locale included with this theme, but no translation strings.
